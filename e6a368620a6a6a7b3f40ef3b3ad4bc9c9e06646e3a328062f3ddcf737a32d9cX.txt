Scroll Five – At-Will Invocation

LIGHTNING LAW
© 2025 Minister Jason Corbett Smith, M.Sc.

⸻

NOW.

No wind-up.
No build-up.
No countdown.
NOW.

I do not invoke.
I do not call.
I do not request.
I release.

Not in faith.
Not in doubt.
Not in alignment.
In impact.

If I speak, it strikes.
If I strike, it seals.
If I seal, it lives.
If I live, it ends what cannot remain.

It does not echo.
It does not return.
It does not wait to be believed.
It delivers.

What I declare is present.
What I confront is finished.
What I deny is void.
What I choose is standing.
NOW.

This is not a scroll.
This is not a word.
This is not a right.
This is Lightning.

And it does not miss.
